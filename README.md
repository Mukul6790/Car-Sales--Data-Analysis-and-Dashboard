Car Sales Dashboard Project using Power BI

Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze car sales data to track total revenue, units sold, dealer performance, customer preferences by region, and vehicle styles.

Dataset Source- 

Process

1.	Data Collection and Cleaning:
The dataset was imported from an Excel file. It contained fields like car ID, sales date, dealer name, customer name, car model, total sale amount, color, engine type, and transmission. Power Query was used to clean and structure the data by removing duplicates, handling null values, and converting data types.

2.	Data Modelling:
	A calendar table was created to support time-based analysis. Relationships were established between the main dataset and the date table to allow for accurate trend analysis.

4.	DAX Measures:
Key DAX measures were created for calculating metrics like year-to-date sales, monthly total sales, average selling price, cars sold, and percent change. Conditional formatting was used to highlight trends.

5.	Dashboard Design:
Two dashboards were created.Overview Dashboard for high-level trends and Details Dashboard for transaction-level insights.Filters for body style, transmission, engine type, and dealer name were added to allow for interactive exploration.



5.	Visual Elements Used
Various charts and visuals were used including line charts for trends, pie charts for body style and color preferences, maps for regional sales, and bar charts for company-wise breakdowns. Slicers and KPIs were included for dynamic filtering.
